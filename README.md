Please fork or clone the github repository from main, and open this package in your prefered IDE, as long as said IDE has a console that can work with Node (most can these days). After doing so please acces the main folder inside the read-thisGen folder with your console, execute {npm init}, then execute the script.js file inside the js folder, by executing {node js/script.js}. After that all you need to do is follow the prompts in the console and add the content you want. Once done writting out your content, and finishing the last question your readme will be generated into the createdReadMes folder and you can do whatever you want with it from there! Please note rarely with certain operating system permissions, you will need to install requirer with node when opening this project for the first time, don't worry its super easy, all you need to is run {node i requirer} , in the main directory of the project.

## Contribution

If you would like to contribute to this project, please message me on GitHub or email me @-(milocohenelyanow@gmail.com) With your specific inquiry, Im pretty much cool with anything, but if you run it by me I can probably make your life a little easier. Otherwise just download the main branch or fork it and work from there!

## futureImprovements

I was messing around with getting inquirer to actualy prompt these questions asynchronously, that way the script can prompt you with different sections and you can add the content to our chosen sections. This turned out to be a bit of a conundrum, as I'm just now at the time of making this learning how to use async, but in the future I am confident this will be a easy change so watch out for that!
